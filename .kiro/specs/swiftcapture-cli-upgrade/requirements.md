# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for upgrading the existing SwiftCapture CLI tool to a comprehensive, professional-grade screen recording application. The upgrade will transform the current basic tool into a feature-rich CLI application with proper argument parsing, multiple recording modes, device management, and enhanced user experience. The goal is to create a tool suitable for distribution via Homebrew with both English and Chinese documentation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Command Line Interface Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a professional CLI interface with proper help documentation and argument parsing, so that I can easily understand and use all available features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user runs `scap --help` or `scap -h` THEN system SHALL display comprehensive help documentation in English
2. WHEN user provides invalid arguments THEN system SHALL display clear error messages and usage hints
3. WHEN user runs command without arguments THEN system SHALL use sensible defaults and display current settings
4. IF user provides conflicting arguments THEN system SHALL display error and suggest correct usage

### Requirement 2: Duration Control

**User Story:** As a user, I want precise control over recording duration with millisecond accuracy, so that I can capture exactly the content I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user specifies `--duration 5000` or `-d 5000` THEN system SHALL record for exactly 5000 milliseconds
2. WHEN user specifies `--duration 1500` THEN system SHALL record for 1.5 seconds with millisecond precision
3. IF no duration is specified THEN system SHALL use default duration of 10000ms (10 seconds)
4. WHEN duration is less than 100ms THEN system SHALL display warning but proceed with recording

### Requirement 3: Output File Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want flexible output file naming and location options, so that I can organize my recordings efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user specifies `--output /path/to/file.mov` or `-o /path/to/file.mov` THEN system SHALL save recording to specified path
2. IF no output path is specified THEN system SHALL save to current directory with timestamp format `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.mov`
3. WHEN output file already exists THEN system SHALL prompt user for overwrite confirmation or auto-append number
4. IF output directory doesn't exist THEN system SHALL create necessary directories

### Requirement 4: Screen Area Selection

**User Story:** As a user, I want to specify exact recording areas and screen regions, so that I can capture only the content I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user specifies `--area 0:0:1920:1080` or `-a 0:0:1920:1080` THEN system SHALL record specified rectangular area (x:y:width:height)
2. IF no area is specified THEN system SHALL record entire screen (full screen mode)
3. WHEN area coordinates exceed screen bounds THEN system SHALL display error and suggest valid coordinates
4. WHEN user specifies `--area center:800:600` THEN system SHALL record 800x600 area centered on screen

### Requirement 5: Multi-Screen Support

**User Story:** As a user with multiple displays, I want to list available screens and select which one to record, so that I can capture content from any connected display.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user runs `--screen-list` or `-sl` THEN system SHALL display all available screens with index numbers and resolutions
2. WHEN user specifies `--screen 1` or `-s 1` THEN system SHALL record from primary display (index 1)
3. WHEN user specifies `--screen 2` THEN system SHALL record from secondary display (index 2)
4. IF specified screen index doesn't exist THEN system SHALL display error and list available screens
5. IF no screen is specified THEN system SHALL default to primary screen (index 1)

### Requirement 6: Application Window Recording

**User Story:** As a user, I want to record specific application windows instead of entire screens, so that I can focus on particular applications and maintain privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user runs `--app-list` or `-al` THEN system SHALL display all running applications with their identifiers
2. WHEN user specifies `--app "Safari"` or `-ap "Safari"` THEN system SHALL record only the specified application's windows
3. WHEN specified application is not running THEN system SHALL display error and list available applications
4. WHEN application has multiple windows THEN system SHALL record all windows of that application
5. IF application is minimized THEN system SHALL display warning but attempt to record

### Requirement 7: Audio Recording Control

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want control over microphone audio recording, so that I can create recordings with or without voice narration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user specifies `--enable-microphone` or `-m` THEN system SHALL include microphone audio in recording
2. IF microphone is not available THEN system SHALL display warning and continue with system audio only
3. WHEN user doesn't specify microphone flag THEN system SHALL record system audio only (current behavior)
4. WHEN user specifies `--audio-quality high` THEN system SHALL use high-quality audio settings (192kbps)

### Requirement 8: Advanced Recording Features

**User Story:** As a professional user, I want advanced recording options for different use cases, so that I can optimize recordings for various purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user specifies `--fps 30` THEN system SHALL record at 30 frames per second
2. WHEN user specifies `--quality high` THEN system SHALL use high bitrate and quality settings
3. WHEN user specifies `--format mp4` THEN system SHALL output in MP4 format instead of MOV
4. WHEN user specifies `--show-cursor` THEN system SHALL include cursor in recording
5. IF user specifies `--countdown 3` THEN system SHALL display 3-second countdown before recording starts

### Requirement 9: Configuration and Presets

**User Story:** As a frequent user, I want to save and reuse recording configurations, so that I don't have to specify the same parameters repeatedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user runs `--save-preset "meeting"` THEN system SHALL save current settings as named preset
2. WHEN user runs `--preset "meeting"` THEN system SHALL load and use saved preset settings
3. WHEN user runs `--list-presets` THEN system SHALL display all saved presets with their settings
4. WHEN user runs `--delete-preset "meeting"` THEN system SHALL remove specified preset

### Requirement 10: User Experience and Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback and progress indication during recording, so that I know the system is working correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recording starts THEN system SHALL display recording status with elapsed time
2. WHEN recording is in progress THEN system SHALL show real-time duration counter
3. WHEN recording completes THEN system SHALL display success message with file location and size
4. IF recording fails THEN system SHALL display clear error message and suggested solutions
5. WHEN user presses Ctrl+C during recording THEN system SHALL gracefully stop and save partial recording

### Requirement 11: Documentation and Localization

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive documentation in both English and Chinese, so that I can understand and use all features regardless of my preferred language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user accesses README.md THEN system SHALL provide comprehensive documentation in English by default
2. WHEN user accesses README_zh.md THEN system SHALL provide complete Chinese documentation
3. WHEN user runs `--help --lang zh` THEN system SHALL display help in Chinese
4. WHEN documentation is updated THEN both language versions SHALL be synchronized

### Requirement 12: Distribution and Installation
