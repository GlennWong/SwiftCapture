# SwiftCapture Project Summary

## Project Overview

SwiftCapture is a professional screen recording tool for macOS built with ScreenCaptureKit, featuring a comprehensive CLI interface, multi-screen support, application window recording, and advanced audio/video controls. The project demonstrates modern Swift development practices with a clean, modular architecture.

## Key Features

1. **Professional CLI Interface**: Built with Swift ArgumentParser for robust command-line experience
2. **Multi-Screen Support**: Record from any connected display with automatic detection
3. **Application Window Recording**: Record specific applications instead of entire screens
4. **Advanced Audio Control**: System audio recording with optional microphone input
5. **Flexible Area Selection**: Record full screen, custom areas, or centered regions
6. **Quality Controls**: Configurable frame rates (15/30/60 fps) and quality presets
7. **High-Quality Output**: Professional MOV format with optimized encoding
8. **Preset Management**: Save and reuse recording configurations
9. **Countdown Timer**: Optional countdown before recording starts
10. **Cursor Control**: Show or hide cursor in recordings
11. **Comprehensive Help**: Detailed usage examples and troubleshooting guide

## Technical Architecture

### Modular Design

The project follows a modular architecture with clearly separated concerns:

```
SwiftCapture/
├── CLI/                 # Command-line interface
├── Capture/             # Screen capture implementation
├── Configuration/       # Configuration management
├── Core/                # Core functionality
├── Managers/            # Specialized managers
├── Models/              # Data models
```

### Core Components

1. **SwiftCaptureCommand**: Main CLI entry point using Swift ArgumentParser
2. **ScreenRecorder**: Central coordinator for the recording process
3. **CaptureController**: ScreenCaptureKit integration layer
4. **ConfigurationManager**: Configuration and preset management
5. **Specialized Managers**: Display, Application, Audio, and Output management
6. **SignalHandler**: Graceful shutdown handling
7. **ProgressIndicator**: Recording progress tracking

### Data Flow

1. User executes command with parameters
2. CLI parses and validates arguments
3. Configuration is created from parameters and presets
4. Recording components are initialized
5. ScreenCaptureKit stream is configured and started
6. Video/audio samples are processed and written to file
7. Recording continues until duration expires or user interrupts
8. File is finalized and saved

## Key Technical Implementations

### ScreenCaptureKit Integration

- Proper handling of screen coordinate systems
- Resolution-aware area validation
- Content filtering for screen vs. application recording
- Efficient sample buffer processing

### Resolution Handling

- Retina display scaling factor support
- Pixel vs. logical coordinate systems
- Dynamic resolution calculation based on recording area
- Proper bounds validation

### Audio Management

- System audio capture (macOS 13.0+)
- Microphone audio mixing capabilities
- Quality settings with adaptive bitrates
- Force system audio mode for application recording

### File Output

- MOV format with H.264/HEVC codecs
- Automatic bitrate calculation based on resolution/fps
- Conflict resolution (overwrite, auto-number, cancel)
- Graceful file finalization with timeout protection

### Error Handling

- Comprehensive parameter validation
- User-friendly error messages with suggestions
- Graceful recovery from runtime errors
- Proper signal handling for Ctrl+C interruptions

## Preset System

The preset system allows users to save and reuse configurations:

- JSON-based storage in user preferences
- Full configuration serialization
- Preset listing and management
- Last used tracking

## Performance Considerations

The implementation includes several optimizations:

- Efficient memory management for long recordings
- Adaptive bitrate calculation
- Proper codec selection for different scenarios
- Resolution-aware processing
- Signal handling that doesn't interfere with recording

## Version Compatibility

The code includes version-specific handling:

- macOS 12.3+ requirement for ScreenCaptureKit
- macOS 13.0+ features for system audio
- Backward compatibility for older APIs

## Testing Strategy

The project includes unit tests for:

- Configuration management
- Parameter validation
- Preset storage
- Mock managers for isolated testing

## Development Practices

### Swift Best Practices

- Modern Swift syntax and features
- Protocol-oriented programming
- Error handling with Swift's error types
- Memory management with ARC
- Concurrency with async/await

### Code Organization

- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent naming conventions
- Comprehensive documentation
- Modular design for maintainability

### Quality Assurance

- Comprehensive parameter validation
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful error recovery
- Proper resource cleanup

## Extensibility

The modular architecture makes it easy to extend the project with new features:

- New recording modes can be added through the CaptureController
- Additional output formats can be supported through the OutputManager
- New CLI options can be added to SwiftCaptureCommand
- Additional validation rules can be added to ParameterValidator

## Conclusion

SwiftCapture demonstrates a well-architected, professional-grade Swift application that leverages modern macOS APIs to provide a powerful screen recording solution. The modular design, comprehensive error handling, and attention to user experience make it both robust and user-friendly.

The project serves as an excellent example of modern Swift development practices, showcasing proper use of frameworks like ScreenCaptureKit and AVFoundation, while maintaining clean code organization and extensive documentation.
